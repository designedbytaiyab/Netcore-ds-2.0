# Copy Patterns by Surface

## Buttons & CTAs

- Verb-first: "Create campaign", "Save", "Next step", "Send test email"
- Questions only for destructive actions: "Delete this segment?"
- Wizard: primary "Next step", secondary "Save"

## Headings

- Answer-first: what the user can do, then detail
- Title = job or object ("Audience", "Schedule")
- Subtitle = one line context, never repeat the title

## Errors & alerts

- What went wrong + how to fix. No wit, blame, or jargon.
- "must" / "required" only on errors and critical alerts.

## Empty states

- Why empty + one clear next action. Wit OK if action stays obvious.

## 404

- System works; requested data unavailable. Offer safe navigation back.

## Modals

- Title = decision ("Discard unsaved changes?")
- Actions = outcome labels ("Discard", "Keep editing") not Yes/No

## Toasts

- Title: what happened (sentence case, bold)
- Body: detail or next step
- Auto-dismiss info/success; keep errors until dismissed

## CEE nudges (DS 2.0)

| Type | Notes |
|---|---|
| No CTA | Dark bg `#191919`, white text, backdrop `#17173A` @ 50% |
| With CTA | White bg, title `#17173A`, body `#6F6F8D`, primary `#143F93` ALL CAPS |
| Spotlight | Overlay 0.7-0.8, white ALL CAPS button |

## Buttons (DS 2.0)

- All button labels UPPERCASE: CREATE, SAVE, APPLY, CANCEL (see `ux-writing.md`)
- Verb-first, outcome-clear

## Segmentation & journey

- Segmentation: personalized relevance in plain language
- Journey: triggers, conditions, actions in user language. No builder-internal node names in labels.
