# Netcore Copywriting (Netcorian)

> **Folder:** `copywriting/` — all copy rules live here. Visual/UI rules live in root `SKILL.md` and `netcore-dls2.md`.

Apply these rules to every UI string, alert, empty state, modal, nudge, and customer-facing message.

**DS 2.0 UI:** Button labels are **UPPERCASE** per `../ux-writing.md`. Netcorian voice, jargon rules, and no-em-dash rule still apply.

---

## PRIMARY — Non-negotiables

**Voice:** Brave · Unifying · Authoritative (Netcorian)

**Tone:** Concise · Simple · To the point · Clear · Witty only when safe (never errors or legal)

**Content is king:** Write what the **user** understands, not what engineering or leadership understands.

**Jobs to be done:** Every string must help the user complete a task. If it does not, remove it.

**No em dashes:** Never use `—` in any output. Use a comma, period, colon, or parentheses.

**No jargon:** Use audience, campaign, segment, contacts. Flag internal terms if no plain alternative exists.

**Person & tense:** Address the user as you/your. Never mix me/my and you/your. Present tense for product behaviour.

**Case:** Title Case headings · Sentence case body and helpers · **UPPERCASE for all DS 2.0 button labels** (`../ux-writing.md`) · ALL CAPS for CEE nudges

**Ship gate:** If usability-tested, utility + usability + usefulness scores must be ≥ 4 before customer release.

## SECONDARY — When to trigger

### Explicit triggers (user types these)

| Command | Example |
|---|---|
| `/copy` | `/copy write error messages for campaign setup` |
| `/netcorian` | `/netcorian rewrite this CTA in our brand voice` |
| `/ux-writing` | `/ux-writing review these modal strings` |

### Implicit triggers — user phrases

Activate this skill when the request contains any of these intents or words:

**Writing actions:** write copy · rewrite copy · draft copy · improve copy · review copy · edit copy · polish copy · fix copy · wordsmith · wording · phrasing · in our voice · brand voice · tone of voice · Netcorian · Netcore voice

**UX writing:** UX writing · UX copy · microcopy · UI copy · interface copy · product copy · in-app copy

**Surfaces:** button label · button text · CTA · call to action · error message · validation message · empty state · tooltip · toast · banner · alert · modal copy · confirmation · dialog text · onboarding · nudge · helper text · placeholder · field label · form label · status label · release notes · changelog copy

**Netcore product context:** campaign copy · wizard copy · audience copy · segment copy · journey copy · Raman message · co-marketer copy · CEE copy · CDP copy · email copy · push notification copy

### Does NOT trigger (use root `SKILL.md` instead)

- Build, design, prototype, or style UI with no copy to write
- Colour, font, spacing, component, or layout requests
- Generic marketing with no Netcore product context

### Visual design boundary

For tokens, components, spacing → root `SKILL.md` + `netcore-dls2.md`. Do not invent colours or fonts in this skill.

## Reference files (all inside `copywriting/`)

| File | When to read |
|---|---|
| `references/voice.md` | Voice, tone, design principles → copy |
| `references/rules.md` | Person, tense, case, punctuation, ship gate |
| `references/patterns.md` | Buttons, errors, empty states, modals, nudges, journeys |
| `references/workflows.md` | Draft workflow, pre-ship checklist, user testing gates |
| `references/templates.md` | Feature copy plan, wizard steps, release notes |
| `spec.md` | Full consolidated spec when auditing or onboarding |

---

## Draft workflow

1. Name the user's job
2. Draft headline → body → CTA
3. Voice check: brave, unifying, authoritative?
4. Tone check: concise, simple, clear, witty if appropriate?
5. Hard rules: person, tense, case, no em dashes, no jargon
6. Match terms used elsewhere (segment, audience, campaign)
7. Output as a table; run pre-ship checklist from `references/workflows.md`

---
