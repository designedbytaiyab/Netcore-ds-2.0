# Netcore Copywriting (Netcorian)

Apply these rules to every UI string, alert, empty state, modal, nudge, and customer-facing message. This skill governs **words only**. For colours, fonts, and layout use root `SKILL.md` and `netcore-dls2.md`.

**DS 2.0 UI:** Button labels are **UPPERCASE** per `ux-writing.md`. Netcorian voice, jargon rules, and no-em-dash rule still apply to all copy.

## PRIMARY — Non-negotiables

**Voice:** Brave · Unifying · Authoritative (Netcorian)

**Tone:** Concise · Simple · To the point · Clear · Witty only when safe (never errors or legal)

**Content is king:** Write what the **user** understands, not what engineering or leadership understands.

**Jobs to be done:** Every string must help the user complete a task. If it does not, remove it.

**No em dashes:** Never use `—` in any output. Use a comma, period, colon, or parentheses.

**No jargon:** Use audience, campaign, segment, contacts. Flag internal terms if no plain alternative exists.

**Person & tense:** Address the user as you/your. Never mix me/my and you/your. Present tense for product behaviour.

**Case:** Title Case headings · Sentence case body and helpers · **UPPERCASE for all button labels in DS 2.0 UI** (see `ux-writing.md`) · ALL CAPS for CEE nudges

**Ship gate:** If usability-tested, utility + usability + usefulness scores must be ≥ 4 before customer release.

## SECONDARY — When to trigger

### Explicit triggers
- `/copy [prompt]` or `/netcorian [prompt]`

### Implicit triggers
Activate when the request involves: UX writing, microcopy, button label, error message, empty state, tooltip, toast, modal copy, onboarding text, nudge copy, release notes, campaign wizard labels, Raman messaging, or "rewrite this in our voice".

### Does not trigger
- Pure UI layout or CSS requests with no copy to write (use root `SKILL.md`)
- Generic marketing with no Netcore product context

### Visual design
For tokens, components, spacing → root `SKILL.md` + `netcore-dls2.md`. Do not invent colours or fonts here.

## Draft workflow

1. Name the user's job
2. Draft headline → body → CTA
3. Voice check: brave, unifying, authoritative?
4. Tone check: concise, simple, clear, witty if appropriate?
5. Hard rules: person, tense, case, no em dashes, no jargon
6. Match terms used elsewhere (segment, audience, campaign)
7. Output as a table; run pre-ship checklist from `workflows.md`
